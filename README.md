This C++ code creates a basic implementation of the classic Snake game in a console environment. It defines functions to set up the game, draw the game board, handle user input, and update 
the game logic. The main loop orchestrates the flow of the game, repeatedly invoking these functions until the game ends. Within the game loop, the snake moves around the board according to 
user input, attempting to eat randomly positioned fruit to increase the player's score. The game ends if the snake collides with the boundaries of the board or with its own tail. The code 
utilizes keyboard input detection and console manipulation functions to create a simple interactive gaming experience.
