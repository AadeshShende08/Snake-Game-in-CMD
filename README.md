# Snake-Game-in-Cmd
  This C++ code creates a basic implementation of the classic Snake game in a console environment. It defines functions to set up the game, draw the game board, handle user input, and update 
the game logic. The main loop orchestrates the flow of the game, repeatedly invoking these functions until the game ends. Within the game loop, the snake moves around the board according to 
user input, attempting to eat randomly positioned fruit to increase the player's score. The game ends if the snake collides with the boundaries of the board or with its own tail. The code 
utilizes keyboard input detection and console manipulation functions to create a simple interactive gaming experience.
# Important Library
<b>Windows.h <br>
  windows.h is a Windows-specific header file for the C and C++ programming languages which contains declarations for all of the functions in the Windows API, all the common macros used by Windows programmers, and all the data types used by the various functions and subsystems. It defines a very large number of Windows specific functions that can be used in C. The Win32 API can be added to a C programming project by including the <windows.h> header file and linking to the appropriate libraries. To use functions in xxxx.dll, the program must be linked to xxxx.lib (or libxxxx.dll.a in MinGW). Some headers are not associated with a .dll but with a static library (e.g. scrnsave.h needs scrnsave.lib).<br>
